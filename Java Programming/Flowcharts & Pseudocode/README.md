# Java Programming

Java is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its platform independence and object-oriented approach. This repository is a collection of important Java topics for revision, designed to provide concise code examples and explanations for quick reference. Each file follows proper Java conventions and includes boilerplate code to make understanding the concepts easier.

## Key Features
- Each Java file uses the same **filename and class name** convention for clarity.
- Java files are created with the `.java` extension.
- Boilerplate code, such as the main method, is included for every program.
- Indexed topics for seamless navigation.

## Index
Below is the list of topics covered in this repository (to be updated as new topics are added):
- <a href="">Flowcharts & Pseudocode</a>
- <a href="">Variables & Data Types</a>
- <a href="">Operators</a>
- <a href="">Conditional Statements</a>
- <a href="">Loops (Flow Control)</a>
- <a href="">Patterns</a>
- <a href="">Functions & Scope</a>

(Add links to each topic file in the repository.)

## Java Boilerplate Code
Below is the boilerplate code used in the examples:

```java
// Filename: Example.java

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code goes here
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## Repository Structure
